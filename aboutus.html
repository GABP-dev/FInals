      <h1>Our Origins</h1>
      <p>PizzarazziMNL was established at the start of 2023 and started out as a passion project by my dad who liked to experiment with pizza recipes during quarantine.</p>
    </section>
    <section id = "Inspiration">
      <h1>Inspiration</h1>
      <p>We got tired of the bread-like doughs of pizzas we ordered, we knew we could do better and wanted more people to experience authentic flavors of Naples to Manila.</p>
    </section>
    <section id = "Habit">
      <h1>Mindset</h1>
      <p>One habit is our dedication to constantly improve our recipe. We spent months experimenting with the ratios of our ingredients to stay true to the Neapolitan style, all while adding our own twist.</p>
